# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my work and skills in web development.

## About the Portfolio

This portfolio is one of my first significant projects and remains my favorite. It is built using raw HTML and CSS, supporting a dynamic view. The site has seen numerous updates to improve its design and functionality. I plan to transition it to React in the future for enhanced performance and maintainability.

## Features

Dynamic View: The portfolio adapts to different screen sizes.

Continuous Updates: Regular improvements to design and content
